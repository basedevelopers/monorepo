## Installation

### Package Manager

Install the required packages.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx jsr add @basedev/pay
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpx jsr add @basedev/pay
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dlx jsr add @basedev/pay
```

```bash [bun]
bunx jsr add @basedev/pay
```

### CDN

If you're not using a package manager, you can also use an ESM-compatible CDN such as [esm.sh](https://esm.sh)

```html
<script type="module">
  import { BasePay } from "https://esm.sh/jsr/@basedev/pay";
</script>
```
